HOW TO SET YOUR ADMIN PASSWORD:

1. Open the file: backend/.env

2. Make sure you have this line (with NO spaces around the = sign):
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=Kadaz100

3. Save the file

4. RESTART your backend server (stop it and start it again)

5. The password will now be: Kadaz100

IMPORTANT:
- No spaces before or after the = sign
- No quotes around the password
- No extra lines after it
- The file must be saved as: backend/.env (not backend/.env.txt)

If you want to use a different password, just replace "Kadaz100" with your password.
